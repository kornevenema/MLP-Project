# MLP-Project
Repository for Project for the course 'Machine Learning Project' at the 
Rijksuniversiteit Groningen.

### instructions for data 
After pulling this repository, please download the train and test data from
https://www.kaggle.com/koryakinp/fingers and place the test and train 
directory into the data folder. The MLP-directory should then look like:
```
MLP-Project
|   .gitignore
|   LICENSE
|   main.py
|   README.md
|
└───data
    |   test
    |   train
```

The main.py should then print the number of files of that directory.
